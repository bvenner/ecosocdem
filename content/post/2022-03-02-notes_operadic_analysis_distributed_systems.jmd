I decided to review this paper in conjunction with Foley's **Operads for Complex System Design**. I would like to write a paper on reconciling input quantities (bottom-up) and influence factors (top-down), which was mentioned in the Foley paper. But I thought this might be a good review of the operadic approach, since this is a relatively early paper. There is no overlap between the authors.
