<p>As I briefly mentioned yesterday, Aaran Gare has another meta-narrative that intersects his radical enlightenment meta-narrative.</p>
<p>A meta-narrative is a narrative about narratives. It is a recusive application of the narrative function. I believe in a great diversity of meta functions, or functions that recursively define a concept.</p>
<p>Gare defines a meta-narrative of speculative naturalism that is inspired by [Giordano Bruno]. I’ve never read his work, but I did get the opportunity to visit his square in Rome. His statue is extremely powerful, and it is not hard to imagine it as a lifelike imatation of Bruno’s final hour on earth as he prepared to meet his death in the Campo De Forio.</p>
