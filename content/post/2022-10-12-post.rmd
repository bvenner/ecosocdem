# Implementing category theory

Several computational implementation of category theory use some form of dependent types. Rather than "full" dependent types, first-order logic with dependent types and generalized algebraic theories may be considered as "fragments" of a full dependent type theory and thus more amenable to computational implementation.  

1. First-order logic with dependent types (FOLDS)
2. Generalized algebraic theories (GAT)
3. Categories with families (CwF)

Makkai asserts the similarity between GAT and FOLDS, but claims that both FOLDS is simpler and can be used to implement "generalized invariance".

Palmgren classifies FOLDS as a "logic-enriched type theory" and develops the relationship between FOLDS and categories with families by developing a hyperdoctrine over CwF.

Since Catlab implements generalized algebraic theories, this should be my starting place.
