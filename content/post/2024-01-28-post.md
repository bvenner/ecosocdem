I've hypothesized that financial auditing might be a good vertical for Mycorrhiza Coop to focus on. I'm personally interested in accounting and financial systems. Auditing is controlled inquiry and could be supported in an "inquiry support system".

I developed a strong interest in the resource-event-agent model based on Bob Haugen's interest in this model. I've also been reviewing knowledge graphs, which have been advocated for use with LLMs in cognitive architectures.

Since REA models were developed for relational database systems, how would these be represented in a graph database system?

One possibility is Petri nets. Petri nets were developed to model discrete event dynamical systems. Accounting systems seem to fit this model. Last year, when I was looking more seriously at accounting systems, I found a document that described double-entry accounting systems as a directed graph, with nodes describing accounts and arrows describing monetary flows. But this leaves out the basic modeling of the ledger, which includes time-stamped events. 

Petri nets are used for stock-flow epidemiological models in the AlgebraicJulia package.

Title: A Petri Net Specification of the REA Business Ontology

This paper uses Petri nets to model the resource-events-agent business ontology.
