I tend to read blogs the way that I watch TV right now.  For TV, I wait for the wheat to separate from the chaff, 
wait to see what's recommended, then binge-watch the most highly rated series.  I do the same thing with academic
writers.  Lately, 've been doing the same thing with
Mike Caufield's excellent blog on educational technology:  https://hapgood.us.  However, since my current commitment
(I really mean it this time!) is to write every day, no matter how ill-formed the thought, here we go.

According to Caulfield: 
> I would argue (along with Alan Kay and so many others) that for digital media the most radical affordance is the remixability 
> of the form (what Kay would call its dynamism).
> We can represent ideas not as finished publications, but as editable models that can be shared, redefined, and recontextualized.
