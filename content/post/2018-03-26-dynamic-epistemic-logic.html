<h1>Dynamic epistemic logic in modal homotopy type theory (MHoTT)</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Dynamic epistemic logic is used to formulate multi-agent models</li>
<li>Dynamic epistemic logic is used to formulate Peirce’s abductive logic <span class="citation">[@Ma:2018:Let]</span></li>
<li>MHoTT is used to formalize Hegel’s logic</li>
<li>Hegel’s Science of Logic has been formalized in MHoTT</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion: Developing dynamic epistemic logic within MHoTT could be used to help formalize a Hegelian/Peircean social philosophy.</p>
