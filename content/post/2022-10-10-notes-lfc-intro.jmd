I purchased this book early on in the Aplexsys project. The relationship between logic and cognitive science seems important, and I'm increasingly drawn towards foundational questions in statistics and logic.

Brentano is cited as playing an important role in the project. Deely also referenced Brentano and wrote an entire book comparing Brentano's notion of "intentionality" with semiotics.
