<p>Embedded in David Graber’s <a href="https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/debt/">Debt: The First 5000 Years</a> is a discussion of the origin of the word “dominum” in Roman law. This has an interesting parallel to Ellerman’s critique of the notion that <em>ownership and governance are blent.</em> According to Graber, this confusion could be traced back to the dual meaning of <em>dominum</em> when Roman law was re-introduced into Italy in the 12th century. The Christian connotation of <em>dominum</em> was that of lordship (governance) while the Roman legal meaning was of a private property owner. In Roman law this broked no confusion, since the property owner exerted an absolute authority over his things - his slaves and children (wives were a joint venture between husband and father and therefore were not exclusively under the dominum of the husband.)</p>
<p>Now Ellerman criticies Marx for accepting this dual meaning from fuedalism, but we perhaps should be kinder to Marx in that this concept has deep roots.</p>
