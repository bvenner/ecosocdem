<p>Felin et. al. propose an evolutionary model where novelty corresponds to symmetry breaking in a phase space. They call this the “frame problem,” an explicit link to logic and AI. They do not make an explicit link to semiotics. <span class="citation">[@felin:2014:economic]</span></p>
<p>Caterina and Gangle, in their <em>Iconicity and Abduction</em>, use topos theory to model abduction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the core method of category theory, which lifts properties characterizing individual objects to structural properties characterizing systems of relations linking individuals to one another, helps to illuminate the creative, context-dependent and tenative nature of abductive inference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This notion of learning as “lifting”</p>
<p>David Spivak, in chapters of Seven Sketches <span class="citation">[@spivak:2018:seven]</span>, develops general models of learning from a category-theory perspective. Spivak also developed the idea of category theory as a mathematical model of mathematical modeling.</p>
<p>Peirce links abductive inference to perceptual judgements. Deely develops the Latin view of being as first known as prior to the ens reale/ens rationis distinction, which seems to fit Peirce’s model of speculative grammar prior to logical critic.</p>
<p>Brandom claims that classical pragmatism was unified by an evolutionary theory of knowledge. This meant both that cognition was <em>naturalized</em> and emerged through an evolutionary process, which is now widely accepted. Brandom also claims that the evolutionary theory of knowledge applied to learning itself, with a population of “habits” that were selected through experience. This latter claims sounds pretty individualistic-atomistic.</p>
