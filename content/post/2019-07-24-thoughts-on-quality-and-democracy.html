<p>In Chapter ?? of <em>Pragmatism and the Wide View of Democracy</em>, [frega:2019:pragmatism], Roberto Frega draws on the tradition of ‘democratic experimentalism’ to develop a theory of democratic institutional change. Charles Sabel, one of these authors, explicitly develops a link to quality management systems, particularly the Toyota Production System, in <em>A Real-Time Revolution in Routines</em> [sabel:real:2005].</p>
<p>Sabel’s paper highlights the gap between what businesses (and perhaps other organizations) are learning about social learning and “our capacity for self-rule by familiar, parliamentary means.”</p>
<p>The links between pragmatism and quality management are deep. Deming &amp; Shewart drew upon C. I. Lewis’ book in developing statistical process control in the 1930s.</p>
<p>The links between pragmatism and democracy are equally deep. Dewey’s work <em>The Public and It’s Problems</em>.</p>
<p>I have yet to encounter work on quality management with an anti-capitalist approach.<br />
Critical theory is better represented (e.g. <em>Making Sense of Management</em>.)</p>
<p>This is a long-term interest of mine, and could be developed as a unit within <em>Pragmatic Ecosocialism</em>, probably one of the few units that I would be qualified to develop.</p>
