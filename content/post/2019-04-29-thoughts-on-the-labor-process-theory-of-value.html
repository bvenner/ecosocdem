<p>Many of the “classic” quotes supporting Marx’s support for ecosocialism are from Volume 3 of Capital, where he discusses land rent. But Mosely argues in <em>Marx and Totality</em> <span class="citation">[@mosely:2017:marx]</span> that Volume 3 of Capital divides up a surplus value that is identical to the same quantity developed in Volume 1 of Capital. But does this mean that the ecological concerns so eloquently expressed are marginal to the larger project of Capital? Is Mosely’s characterization of Volume 3 correct? Many of these quotes seem much more global and ambitious than simply restricted to reflections on competition between capitalists.</p>
