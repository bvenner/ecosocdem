This review paper [@molzahn:2017:survey] was cited by Bernstein & Dallâ€™Anese [@bernstein:2019:real].  Stephen Low from CalTech was one of the coauthors.

The dimension of the network admittance matrix Y is unclear.  The notion of 'bus' implies a multi-graph rather than a graph.  I know how to go from graph to matrix, but I don't understand how this is defined.

Wikipedia has an entry on a 'nodal admittance network', which defines the network connecting the buses.
