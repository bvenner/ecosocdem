<p>Tecuci et. al. have made a serious attempt to develop a general approach to evidence-based reasoning based on Schum’s work. These notes are on their latest work <span class="citation">[@tecuci:2019:computational]</span>.</p>
<p>As a preface, my proposed project has leaned towards starting such an investigation with Peircean semiotics, formalized with category theory. So I have a pre-exisiting bias. But Tecuci’s previous work has taken Peirce seriously, in particular Peirce’s abduction-deduction-induction logic of science. Although Bellucci shows that Peirce revised this order in his later work on speculative grammar <span class="citation">[@bellucci:2018:peirce]</span>, we’ll have to await Bellucci’s volumes on Peirce’s speculative rhetoric to see if there was a corresponding impact on his theory of inquiry.</p>
<p>Tecuci begins with identifying abduction with possibility, deduction with necessity and induction with probability. Now one approach to categorical probability is through Lawvere’s space-quantity adjunction, with total probability as an extrinsic quantity and probability density as an intrinsic quantity. Lawvere’s Kan quantifiers form an adjoint pair that generalize first-order logical quantifiers <span class="citation">[@lawvere:1986:taking]</span>.</p>
<p>Adjoint triple from <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/adjoint+triple">Nlab</a>: An adjoint triple of functors gives rise to an adjoint monad/comonad pair; it is the latter that gives rise to the possibility/necessity modalities. The link between the two adjunctions is an adjunction; an adjoint triple is also an adjuction between adjunctions.</p>
<p>The notion of a general theory of knowledge, which must underly any theory of inquiry (as knowledge change), or what Peirce called ‘logical critic’, has been approached in category theory by Patterson, who proposed a variety of categorical knowledge representation formalisms based on different categorical notions. Patterson’s work used the bicategory of relations, but points to a larger framework. As an aside, could the monoidal functor approach as a box developed by Meilles be applied as a knowledge representation framework a la the existential graphs.</p>
<p>An interruption: Nicholas Rescher wrote an introductory book on epistemology and two books on value
theory.</p>
