<p>Rereading Charles Taylor’s short note <span class="citation">[@taylor:2000:comment]</span> on Jurgen Habermas’ discussion of philosophy’s post-Hegel development <span class="citation">[@habermas:1999:kant]</span>. Taylor develops the notion of ‘supersession arguments’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taylor:where we show that there is a rational path from A to B, but not in the reverse direction. But we have to see this path not only as a line of argument, and not only as an actual transition, but as both together <span class="citation">[@taylor:2000:comment]</span>, p. 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It strikes me that “abduction” as the origination of novelty is a key component in the introduction of irreversibility in “cultural evolution.” But this requires a more complete model of cultural evolution. Following Apel, this model should be grounded on the link between theory and practice - the need to stand in our present moment facing the future without the reassurance of ‘historical necessity.’ Because of the widespread Darwinian notion of biological evolution, this isn’t much of a hurdle. The more difficult notion to justify is that reason can intervene in cultural evolution and move it in the proper direction.</p>
<p>So can the idea of supersession arguments be linked to abduction as a logical concept and the symmetry-breaking concept of novelty in Longo’s biological and economic models of evolution. Again, the need to develop concepts in their inter-dependent “moments” of nature, society and culture?</p>
<p>Aside: what to call this? I love “computational trinitarianism” but I’d like to ground this in the Hegelian/Peircian schema.</p>
