<p>I tend to read blogs the way that I watch TV right now. For TV, I wait for the wheat to separate from the chaff, wait to see what’s recommended, then binge-watch the most highly rated series. I do the same thing with academic writers. Lately, ’ve been doing the same thing with Mike Caufield’s excellent blog on educational technology: <a href="https://hapgood.us" class="uri">https://hapgood.us</a>. However, since my current commitment (I really mean it this time!) is to write every day, no matter how ill-formed the thought, here we go.</p>
<p>According to Caulfield: &gt; I would argue (along with Alan Kay and so many others) that for digital media the most radical affordance is the remixability &gt; of the form (what Kay would call its dynamism). &gt; We can represent ideas not as finished publications, but as editable models that can be shared, redefined, and recontextualized.</p>
