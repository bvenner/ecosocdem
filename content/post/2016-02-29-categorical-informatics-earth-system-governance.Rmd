Earth System <- Informatics -> Governance
Ecology <- Covenant -> Democracy

Can categorical informatics contribute to a span connecting the two pillars of earth systems and governance?  

All that can fall within the range of human understanding
is in three categories.  The nature of things as they are in
themselves, their relations, and their manner of operation.
What man himself ought to do, as a thinking and willing
agent, for the attainment of any end, especially happiness.
The ways and means by which the knowledge of each of those two
is attained and communicated. I think that science can properly 
be divided into these three sorts. --- John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Book 4, Chapter xxi.

Key notions in categorical informatics - information integration, updatable views, aggregation, lenses

Covenant as a general theory of norms.
