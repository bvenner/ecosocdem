Poinsot - semiotics and the category of relations
Schelling - what Gare said (is a process a relation or a relation a process?)
Peirce - logic of relatives
Bogdanov - tektology (organizational science)
Rosen - relational biology
Wilbur - critique of systems theory
Mac Lane - category theory

Looking at this list, lots of thinkers that were ignored in their time.

Rosen was quite explicit about the relationship between relational biology and category theory.  Which came first in his thinking?

Category theory as a natural successor to the 'logic of relatives'.   

I broke my first rule and started writing before checking Wikipedia.  There is an entry on (relational theory)
