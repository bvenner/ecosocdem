The term “pragmatic” often seems to be used as a synonym for “ugly.”  How many flights of fancy have been shot down by the pragmatic arrow?  Although pragmatism in this sense has been fully weaponized in our culture, this formulation is not true to its nature.  According to Peirce, the ground of pragmatism, the beginning of knowledge of what would be, is aesthetics, and so the logic of pragmatism depends upon play.

In Peirce’s pragmaticism, aesthetics is the foundation of normative philosophy, the study of what “would be”.

Philosophy for the regenerative society:  ecology, society, semiotic.
