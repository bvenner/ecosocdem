I'm reading this as part of my project to advocate 'collective intelligence' with the 'citizen science' initiative.

Roberto Mangabeira Unger co-wrote this paper with Geoff Mulgan, author of Big Mind and in charge of something at Nesta. After discovering this paper I ended up watching a few videos of Unger co-presenting with Jeffery Sachs, which was a great comparison for Unger. I find his style a little off-putting, but when compared with Sachs I'll definitely take his passion for progressivism.  In these videos, Unger outlines his political program for a progressive alternative that is very reminiscent of Dewey in general. One contemporary update is his focus on the "knowledge economy". My sense is that his understanding is more shallow than the frameworks developed by the P2P Foundation, but this work is considerably more mainstream and it may tie into the more generic 'collective intelligence' framework, which has the benefit of being more technocratic and thus potentially more interesting to EPA higher-ups than Unger's more overtly political program (or Mackenzie Wark's Hacker's Manifesto or my democratic ecosocialist leanings).

This might be one of the best outlines for the transformative potential of the knowledge economy that I have read. Although less artistic than "Hacker's Manifesto", it is more concrete and grounded, the work of an artistic lawyer rather than a lawful artist. Although it bears similarity to various P2P Foundation proposals, as the work of a single author it strikes me as slightly more coherent. 

> Another emerging set of approaches, ‘data trusts’, focus on creating legal structures to
provide independent stewardship of data for the benefit of a group of organisations
or people that wish to use it.71

Energy data trusts seem particularly important. 

It might be unfair to say, given my relatively shallow reading of Unger's work and my overall agreement with his project, but it seems like Unger uses a Kantian dualism between humanity, which is totally free, and a natural philosophy that is necessitarian. This seems like an unfair critique, given Unger's position against 'liberalism' in his early work in *Knowledge and Politics*.
