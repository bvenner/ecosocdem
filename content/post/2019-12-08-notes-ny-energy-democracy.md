started campaign about a year ago.  At the beginning, no one was interested.  Climate movement dominated by liberals without interest in public ownership.

Had a big kickoff for campaign.  Two tactics.  Send letters/other contacts to legislators.  Canvassing.  Split members into tables based on who their state legislators are.

Sunrise, XR, various other smaller groups in coalition.
