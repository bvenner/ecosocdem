<h2>towards categorical pragmatics</h2>
<p>Spivak’s research program on applying category theory as a general theory of agent interactions can be interpeted as a form of categorical pragmatics.</p>

<h3>categorical semantics</h3>
<p>Peirce develops a rudimentary speech-act theory within speculative grammar. This is a theory of ‘pragmatics’</p>

<div id="sign-object-interpretant" class="section level1">
<h1>sign, object, interpretant</h1>
<p>This section will be focused on developing a category theoretic approach to Peirce’s classification of signs, with a particular focus on the speech-act elements of this theory.</p>
<p>This section will re-derive the main results of the 66 classes of signs from the viewpoint of morphisms within category of partial orders.</p>
<p>Another possible structure is the idea of symmetric monoidal categories enriched in posets (i.e. order-enriched), which was discussed by Drew Moshier at the ACT conference.</p>
<p>Intepretation as partial order. Discuss Peirce’s late work three-valued logic. Close relationship between modal ideas and three-valued logic.</p>
<p>Compare to modal intepretation of being-nothing-becoming in Schneider’s work.</p>

<div id="deduction-abduction-induction" class="section level1">
<h1>deduction, abduction, induction</h1>
<p>Peirce’s analysis of the three figures of the syllogism.</p>
<p>Fibrational semantics of the syllogism. General notion of fibration.</p>
</div>
<div id="alpha-beta-gamma" class="section level1">
<h1>alpha, beta, gamma</h1>
<p>Existential graphs. State of modal graphs. Categorical interpretation of beta existential graphs. Meilles work on Peirce-like beta graphs.</p>
