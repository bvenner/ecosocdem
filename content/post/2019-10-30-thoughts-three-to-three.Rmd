There are 10 order-preserving morphisms from the ordered category *three* to itself.  Do these correspond to Peirce's 10 classes of signs?

To make the correpondence to category theory more obvious, the three ordered objects are $0, *, 1$.  As a category, $1$ is the terminal object, $0$ is the initial object, and $*$ is the mediate object.  In categorical dialectics, these correspond to being, nothing, and becoming, with the initial and terminal objects also corresponding to a monad/comonad pair.

The ordered domain and codomain play different roles.
