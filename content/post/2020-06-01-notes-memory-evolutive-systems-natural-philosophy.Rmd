Ambitious paper with the intent of developing memory evolutive systems as a general framework for 'natural philosophy'.  I'd seen this paper a few months ago but am taking the time to read it now as part of my presently revived 'categorical metrology' paper, which I'd like to work on in parallel with my November uncertainty training.  But the long term goal is to develop a metrology supporting Marxist ecological economics.

From the abstract:
> Among the main results:
- (i) a mathematical translation of the part–whole problem (using the categorical operation colimit) which shows how the different interpretations of the problem support diverging philosophical positions, from reductionism to emergentism and holism;
- (ii) an explanation of the emergence, over time, of structures and processes of increasing complexity order, through successive ‘complexification processes’.

Section 1.1, *Mathematical models in physics*, announces the authors as members of the same tribe as me, citing Longo's work on phase spaces and integral biomathics, which Gare worked on.  Unfortunately, I can't rely on my prior knowledge of these works, just familiarity.

Section 1.3 uses the term 'holon' and 'holarchy', referencing Arthur Koestler's book *Janus: A summing Up* [koestler:1978:janus].
