<p>Earth System &lt;- Informatics -&gt; Governance Ecology &lt;- Covenant -&gt; Democracy</p>
<p>Can categorical informatics contribute to a span connecting the two pillars of earth systems and governance?</p>
<p>All that can fall within the range of human understanding is in three categories. The nature of things as they are in themselves, their relations, and their manner of operation. What man himself ought to do, as a thinking and willing agent, for the attainment of any end, especially happiness. The ways and means by which the knowledge of each of those two is attained and communicated. I think that science can properly be divided into these three sorts. â€” John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Book 4, Chapter xxi.</p>
