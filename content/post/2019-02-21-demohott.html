<p>While reading some of Pat Devine’s papers on democratic planning, I got the strong sense that formal models, using dynamic epistemic modal logic, of the democratic planning process might be helpful. Ideally, these models would be helpful for both theory and practice. As a theory of multi-agent models, they might be useful for studying economic processes with a knowledge slant, as required under Devine’s model. But hopefully it could also be useful for engineering software systems to support democratic planning.</p>
<p>Dynamic epistemic modal logic has been used in theories of knowledge already. Developing these modal systems from within modal homotopy type theory might be a way to tie these to an Hegelian/Peircean framework of knowledge and epistemology.</p>
<p>Perhaps a good place to start would be Spivak’s temporal type theory.</p>
