<p>Googled “category theory value,” found a paper by Geoff Hellman entitled “Does category theory provide a framework for mathematical structuralism” <span class="citation">[@hellman:2003:category]</span>. Since this paper was from 2003, it does not consider homotopy type theory or it’s modal varieties. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Hellman is a leading proponent of ‘mathematical nominalism’, so he would not take a pragmatic realistic view of math, contra Peirce. Nevertheless, he does reference Bell’s work on local mathematics and proposes to use ‘modal structuralism’ to strengthen his claim.</p>
<p>Graeber’s <em>Towards an Anthropological Theory of Value</em> is awesome. The writing is clever and the ideas are interesting. So far, the central thesis of the book seems very consistent with my ideas for <a href="http://github.org/bvenner/semiotics-values">*Semiotic of values</a>, but also seems to require development of <a href="http://github.org/bvenner/categorical-semiotics"><em>categorical semiotics</em></a>. It is interesting that Greaber proposes a generalization of Marx’s theory of value towards a more general notion of “action,” and critiques the use of semiology, but does not mention Peirce.</p>
<p>I’d like to structure the course to reflect the subject matter. Students taking the course for a grade are engaged in a value creation and evaluation process. Different class projects could embody different theories of value. Ultimately, student grades would depend upon common-based peer production, perhaps their contribution to a course website that could be used as the main text for the course. The public-facing part of the website could include acceptable limited-use of copyrighted texts, while a private-facing part could contain electronic copies</p>
