Weaving Two Left-Hegelian Threads

Outline of paper:
Non-violent socialist revolution - an oxymoron
MLK as an inheritor of the pragmatist tradition
German critical theory and it’s encounter with American pragmatism
Weaving “pragmatic” and “principled” non-violence together through discourse ethics

Non-violent socialist revolution - an oxymoron

Marxism and anarchism as two violent ideologies that arose from left hegelian thought

1871 Paris Commune as ‘blood soaked’

Bakunin as prescient critic of ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ 

State socialism

MLK’s non-violent philosophy as a variety of pragmatism

From this viewpoint, there is a certain irony in distinguishing non-violence used strategically as “pragmatic non-violence”

Hegel->Peirce->Royce->Thurman->King 


American pragmatism 
MLK as an inheritor of the left-Hegelian thought

Josiah Royce
