Use of post-Keynesian stock-flow consistent models in general constrained dynamics in energy modeling. A previous paper by the 

The resulting differential-algebraic equations looks formally similar to the differential-algebraic equations that govern power systems.

What would a post-Keynesian energy model look like? At the lowest level, this could be a stock-flow consistent agent-based model, perhaps building on SwarmGrid-X. My sense is that something like the 

From the top-down level, the model could replace the 'inter-temporal' optimizing decision-maker with the 'sectoral-balance' approach. 

The other benefit of the 'constrained dynamics' approach is that we are looking for
