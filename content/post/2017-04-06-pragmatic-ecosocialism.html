<p>An attempt at political philosophy based on Peirce’s pragmatism. A parallel construction to <a href="https://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/bsp.55/main">pragmatic realism</a> as a description of Peirce’s metaphysics. Build upon the notion of a social-ecological system, global in scope. Notions of wealth: social, ecological and built. Property as a conditional relationship on built environment but ultimately secondary or instrumental to social and ecological wealth. Commons asset trusts for ecological wealth.</p>
<p>Philosophy as a bridge between the <em>psychical</em> and <em>physical</em> sciences - a similar construction to Locke.<br />
Peirce’s notion of philosophy as coenoscopy. Social-ecological systems are studied by methods in the special sciences and do not take a reductive, rationalistic approach to the subject matter.</p>
<p>Parallels between mind-body and social-ecological relationship. Peirce’s notion of mind as intrinsically social.</p>
<p>Relationship between Peirce and Hegel. Foundational role of Hegelianism within socialism. Relationship between the universal categories and dialectical materialism. How pragmaticism addresses limitations within Hegelianism.</p>
<p>Relationship to “real utopias.” <em>Do not block the road to inquiry</em> as applied to social systems. Applied semiotics as allowing cyber-physical-social systems to develop. Simulating real utopias to improve cyber-physical-social systems.<br />
Ellerman’s exploitation/exploration analysis - need for multiple parallel explorations of future states. Multi-agent systems and agent-based simulations as related approaches to cyber-physical-social systems.</p>
<p>Ecological macroeconomics as a foundational approach, but with an institutional flavor including knowledge, law, logic, etc.</p>
