# Not for public 

## Assumptions

- Software for emergency response can be repurposed for social action

- decision making in the face of rapidly changing situations, 

- real-time coordination of a diverse group of technical and social actors 

- research on making networks more resilient (white hat) vs identifing pressure points capable of movement by social action (black hat) 

## (Planetary Network) (Emergency Response) 

- A planetary-scale network for emergency response

- Public facing, working in a climate adaptation 

- Target customers: governments and NGOs (enterprise), citizens (free and low cost) 

## (Planetary Emergency) (Response Network)

- Responding to the planetary emergencies in a globally coordinated fashion

- Activist facing, working on climate mitigation

- Target customers: social action networks (free or low-cost) 

## PERN vs Pern

- Name deliberately plays on the Dragonriders of Pern novels by Anne McCaffrey 

- In the novels, a bacronym for *Parallel Earth, Resources Negligible*

- In the novels, dragonriders are emergency responders against Thread, a mycorrhizoid spore

- Can use book references for releases, web examples

## Slogans

- Perceive, think, and act planetarily

- Save lives, the money will follow 

# Vision

## Sketch

- Climate change has been and will continue to lead to large-scale disasters

- Prevention/preparedness - planning for resilience

- Response - rapid coordination of volunteers and professionals to respond effectively to emergency situations

- Relief - coordination of resource flows to affected areas

# Technology Stack

## Dynamic Social Knowledge Graphs

- Open Street Map

- TerminusDB/TerminusCMS 

## Cognitive Language Agents

- Information extraction from social media posts, drone imagery, satellite images

- Human/machine interactions to aid decision-making

## Empowered Mobile Actors

- Access to real-time information on resilient information networks 

- Used by humans and machines

- Most direct precursor to PERN

- Organized on disaster-specific basis, last used in 2019

- Crowd-sourced use of human volunteers to assess satellite images to help direct on-ground emergency responders

- Used 3,619 volunteers to examine 25K sat imagaes

- Pre-LLM
