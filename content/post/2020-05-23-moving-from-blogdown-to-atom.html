<p>I’m spending this morning configuring my notebook to use Atom, not Blogdown within RStudio. Why? I’ve migrated to an old iMac, and I use multiple screens to compose, whereas RStudio uses multiple panes and thus is difficult to use in this configuration. I also rarely use the R features. I also want to converge my environment with Nick’s. On the other hand, I’ve spent quite a bit of time screwing around with it - it probably would have been easier to reconfigure the default layout in RStudio. Oh well.</p>
<p>I installed “Markdown Writer” within Atom. This allows for per-project configuration files, which it creates in mdwriter.cson.</p>
<p>Installing hugo locally required a lot of wrangling to get Homebrew to work. After many tries, a failed uninstall of Homebrew followed by a reinstall seemed to work.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Hugo did not work out of the box. Building the website gave xml versions but not html. That’s OK - I knew that I would run into issues. It seems like blogdown did not</p>
