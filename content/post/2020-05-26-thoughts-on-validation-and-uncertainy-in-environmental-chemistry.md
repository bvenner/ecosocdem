# Metrology

"Amount of substance" in the SI is very different from the other 6 base units.  The others are traceable to fundamental physical constants, which typically relate different areas of physics.  However, amount of substance is now simply a number, with no particular reference to any particular physical system.  

Jacob's notion of 'state' fits well with the notion of chemical state as a mixture of 'elementary' particles.  

# Computation

## Business process modeling using Petri nets

Would it be helpful to distinguish the validation process from the inference process?  My previous attempt to apply Bayesian networks to the validation process used a hierarchical model to arrange validation information, with primary sample at the top.  

## Behavioral mereology

Could Spivak's work on behavioral mereology be applied to the notion of analytical method?  There are two main domains - material type and analytical method.  But can these really be modeled as hierarchies?  Material type seems more like a complex domain with many attributes.
