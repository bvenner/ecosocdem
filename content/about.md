Once upon a time an impressionable graduate student in _statistics_ read [*Probability:  The Logic of Science*](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf) by Edwin Jaynes.  Later, while trying to understand the concept of *representative sample*, he was introduced to concept of _semiotics_ through the philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce.

So this blog is on Statistics, Semiotics [and All That](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/and_all_that).
